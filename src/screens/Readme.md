# Components

### Screens

Screens are _smart_ components which are used for data fetching, navigation
and state handling. A user navigates between screens.

### Views

Views are _dumb_ components and get all their data from screens and usually
don't need their own state. They are easier testable and their outcome
is predictable.

### Examples

Examples fill views with fixture data to show a specific state of the view.
Used as the default component with live reload they can be used to quickly
iterate on a view.
